# MRVAT
The Melting Range Visualization and Analysis Tool (MRVAT) uses Thermo-Calc .exp files to calculate and visualize the melting temperature and liquid phase fraction of alloys. It transforms complex data into intuitive melting range cloud plots, demonstrated with the Al-Fe-Si system using CALPHAD and experimental data.
