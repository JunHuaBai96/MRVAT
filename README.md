**Melting Range Visualization and Analysis Tool (MRVAT)** is a software tool designed to calculate and visualize the relationship between the temperature and liquid phase fraction of alloys with different compositions. It processes `.exp` files generated by the Thermo-Calc software and transforms complex data into intuitive melting range cloud plots. This tool is demonstrated using the **Al-Fe-Si** thermodynamic database by Du et al. (2008), combining CALPHAD and experimental data for thermodynamic analysis.
The tool is demonstrated using the Al-Fe-Si thermodynamic database provided by Du, Y., Schuster, J. C., Liu, Z. K., Hu, R., Nash, P., Sun, W., ... & Krendelsberger, N. (2008), which combines the CALPHAD method with key experimental data to describe the thermodynamics of the alloy system. With this tool, users can easily interpret and visualize the temperature range and liquid phase fractions of alloys across various compositions.
